# Welcome to Heart-Disease-Analysis!

## Description
This is our mini project for the SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence module. In this project, we used classification models to predict if an individual has heart disease. We utilised classification models because we wanted to identify different categories in the dataset and use these categories to make a prediction.

## Problem Definition
* Can we predict whether a person has heart disease?
* Which classification model is the best at predicting whether a person has heart disease?

## Data Preparation

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Machine Learning
We utilised the following classification models:
1. Decision Trees
2. XGBoost
3. Logistic Regression

## Conclusion

## Learning Something New and Areas for Improvement
Through this project, we learnt the following:
* How to clean and prepare datasets, especially those with many categorical variables
*
